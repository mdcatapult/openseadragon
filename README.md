## MDC OpenSeaDragon

MDC clone of [openseadragon](https://github.com/thejohnhoffer/openseadragon).  Please refer to the original [README](https://github.com/thejohnhoffer/openseadragon/blob/webgl2/README.md) for further details.

### but why?

Medicines Discovery Catapult (MDC) use openseadragon but target a specific branch which is installed from GitHub.  This repo is cloned at
that branch.  This then enables us to build and push the package to npm.

### git remotes

The original remote has been renamed as `upstream` - to get changes run `git fetch upstream`.  `origin` now references the present (MDC) repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/mdcatapult/viawebgl).
